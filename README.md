# This application is an updated version of MOE written in C# and XAML utilizing the .NET MAUI framework.

# The database file should be put in a folder generated by the application within the AppData folder.

# The application opens up to a 3x3 grid layout which contains six buttons and three search bars, one for personale, plaza, and organization.
